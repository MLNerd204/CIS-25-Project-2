# CIS-25-Project-2

# The purpose of this program is to mannage a library system so that users are able to store, retrieve, remove, and desplay all book information as provided. The information provided would also tell if that book has been borrowed or returned according to the stored data. Using structures would allow the user to define book as title, author, ID(identification number), and release date. The program would also have implement functions to search for books, display all books, and manage the inventory as well. Additionally I would also add a borrow and return function to see if the book found has been returned or borrowed.
